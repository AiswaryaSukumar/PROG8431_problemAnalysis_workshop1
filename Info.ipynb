    "\n",
    "AI/ML cybersecurity attacks differ from traditional ones by targeting models and data rather than only networks or software. Adversarial examples, data poisoning, and model theft manipulate outcomes subtly, often escaping standard detection methods. Unlike traditional attacks that usually disrupt systems directly, AI/ML attacks undermine trust in automated decision-making, leading to hidden but severe consequences such as biased predictions or security misclassifications. Detection is harder because malicious inputs often resemble normal data, leaving little trace. These challenges reveal defense gaps in AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for specialized, proactive security frameworks tailored to protect models, training pipelines, and datasets\n",

    "##  Data Cleansing Plan \n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing any analysis, we must ensure our data is clean, consistent, and reliable. Based on best practices in data science, our cleansing plan includes the following key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove duplicates and irrelevant entries  \n",
    "   - Eliminate duplicate rows.  \n",
    "   - Filter out irrelevant categories that don't align with our research focus (e.g., non-AI or non-traditional attack types).  \n",
    "   *“Remove duplicate or irrelevant observations,” as essential for accurate analysis*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fix structural inconsistencies\n",
    "   - Trim whitespace, unify text case, and correct typos (e.g., “AI Security” vs. “ai – security”).  \n",
    "   *“Structural errors such as typos or incorrect capitalization can mislabel categories,” leading to skewed grouping* \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handle missing values\n",
    "   - Identify columns with missing values (`count` vs. total rows).  \n",
    "   - Decide on a strategy: drop rows with critical missing fields or fill with placeholders like `\"Unknown\"`.  \n",
    "   *Dropping or imputing missing values ensures downstream processes aren’t disrupted* \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Standardize formats and categories\n",
    "   - Normalize categories (e.g., group “AI Security,” “AI/ML Security,” and “LLM Exploits” under a single “AI/ML” label).  \n",
    "   - Ensure consistency in category names and formats across the dataset.  \n",
    "   *Standardization ensures that categories are comparable and consistent* \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verify data integrity & structure\n",
    "   - Confirm that each row contains expected fields and data types (e.g., numerical vs. string).  \n",
    "   - For critical fields, perform manual checks as needed to ensure high-quality data entry.  \n",
    "   *Data integrity checks help ensure data is “fit for use” in analysis* \n"
