    "Is Our cloud system secure ?\n",

    "This is too vague. Security is multi-dimensional: data encryption, access control, monitoring, compliance, insider threats, etc. A vague question leads to poor risk assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Organizations often ask broad, unclear questions like “Are we secure?” without specifying scope.\n",

    "Poorly framed cybersecurity questions, such as “Is our cloud secure?”, ignore the complexity of modern threats. Cloud misconfigurations and weak identity policies remain the leading causes of breaches, often exploited via credential theft or exposed storage buckets. Without precise scoping, organizations risk false confidence, regulatory fines, and reputational harm. Expert input from business, security, and compliance teams is essential to refine vague inquiries into actionable ones like “Are our IAM roles aligned with zero-trust principles?”. Structured questions enable accurate risk assessment, effective monitoring, and cost-efficient defenses against evolving cloud threats\n",
