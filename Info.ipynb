    "We are a group of students conducting research on AI/ML Security. Our focus is on understanding: How do AI/ML-related cybersecurity attacks differ from traditional attacks in terms of impact and detection, and what does this reveal about the current defense gaps in AI systems? Write a short essay (maximum 100 words) summarizing the findings.\n",

    "AI/ML cybersecurity attacks differ from traditional ones by targeting models and data rather than only networks or software. Adversarial examples, data poisoning, and model theft manipulate outcomes subtly, often escaping standard detection methods. Unlike traditional attacks that usually disrupt systems directly, AI/ML attacks undermine trust in automated decision-making, leading to hidden but severe consequences such as biased predictions or security misclassifications. Detection is harder because malicious inputs often resemble normal data, leaving little trace. These challenges reveal defense gaps in AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for specialized, proactive security frameworks tailored to protect models, training pipelines, and datasets\n",
